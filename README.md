# CryptMage 🛡️✨
**Vault. Cipher. Guard.**

CryptMage is a high-security, local-first password manager built for Android. It leverages industry-standard cryptography and modern Android architectural patterns to ensure user data remains private, secure, and accessible
only to the owner.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Zero-Knowledge Security:** All data is encrypted locally. The encryption key is derived from the user's master password and is never stored on the device.
- **Full Database Encryption:** Uses **SQLCipher** to encrypt the entire Room database with AES-256.
- **Hardware-Backed Protection:** Secure management of cryptographic salts using the **Android KeyStore System**.
- **Modern UI:** Built entirely with **Jetpack Compose** following Material 3 guidelines.
- **Auto-Locking:** Intelligent session management that locks the vault when the app enters the background.
- **Privacy Guard:** Prevents screenshots and hides sensitive data in the "Recent Apps" switcher using `FLAG_SECURE`.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose (100%)
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Clean Architecture + Single Activity
- **Dependency Injection:** Koin
- **Persistence:** Room Database + SQLCipher
- **Asynchronous Logic:** Coroutines & Flow
- **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 (via BouncyCastle)
- **UI Scaling:** SDP/SSP for responsive layouts across all screen sizes.

## 🔒 Security Model
CryptMage implements a multi-layered security approach:

**Master Key Derivation:** Uses **PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256** with a unique salt to derive a 256-bit AES key from the user's password.
**Salt Protection:** The salt is encrypted using a hardware-backed AES key generated via `KeyGenParameterSpec` in the Android KeyStore before being saved to storage.
**Memory Safety:** The derived encryption key exists in memory as a `ByteArray` only during the database initialization phase and is zeroed out immediately after use to prevent memory dump attacks.
**Lazily-Loaded Vault:** Database operations are restricted until the user provides the correct master key to unlock the SQLCipher open helper.

## 🗺️ Architecture Overview
The project follows **Google's official architecture guidance** for modern Android development:

- **UI Layer:** Composable screens observing `StateFlow` from ViewModels. Implements Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF).
- **Domain Layer:** Business logic encapsulated in `Managers` and `Requests` handlers to keep ViewModels clean and testable.
- **Data Layer:** Repository pattern mediating between the UI and the encrypted Room database.
